<h2><i>One of the primary manifestations of climate change of far is melt.north america,europe and asia have all seen
    a trend toward less snow vcover between 1960 and 2015,according to 2016 research <mark>published in the journal current climate changes 
        reports.</mark></p>

<p>As dramatic as the effects of climate change are expected to be on the natural world,the projected changes to human society may be on
    even motre devastating.</p>

<p>Aggricultural systems will likely be dealt a cripping blow.though growing seasons in some areas will expand ,the combined impacts  
    of drought,severe weather,lack of accumulated snowmelt,greater number and diversity of pests ,lower groundwater tables and a loss 
    of arable land could cause severe crop failures and livestock shortages worldwide.</p>

    <p>Nearly all lands are seeing more hot days abd heat waves.2020 was one of the hotest years on the record.higher-temoperature 
        increases heat-related illness and can make it more difficult to work and move around.wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when conditions re hotter.
    </p>

    <p>Changes in temperature causes changes in rainfall.this results in more severe and frequent stroms.they cause,flooding and landsliudes,
        destroying homes and communities,and costing billions of dollars.
    </p>

    <p>The ocean soaks up most of the heat form global warming.this melts ice sheets and raise sea levels,threatening coastal and island 
        communities.the ocean also absorbs carbon dioxide,keeping it from the atmosphere.more carbon dioxide makes the ocean more acidic,
        which endagers marine life.
    </p>

    <p>Climate changes poses risks in to the survival of species on land and in the ocean.these risks increases as temperature climb.
        forest fires,extreme weather,and invasive pests and diseases are among many threats.some species will be able to relocate and survive,bu others will not.
